## Intro

Programming a robot is easy, programming a robot well is hard. The purpose of this repository is to help the team implement more complex software features, and to avoid re-implementing the same tasks over and over. Some tasks which would be applicable to all years and might eventually be part of this repository:
- Powerful, easy-to-implement autonomous programming
- Motion profiling
- Use of complex, external sensors such as gyros
- Logging

Currently, the first two features are the focus of development. Ideally, programming a highly accurate, multistep autonomous should take minutes, assuming the needed profiles and actions have already been written.

While this project is designed for use on FRC robots running the 2015-current WPILIBJ control system, many of the classes are completely decoupled from a physical implementation. The following classes could be used on any system:
- Everything the control package except for:
	- [CommandExecutor](#commadnexecutor)
	-
	-

## Framework

### Basic robot classes

The following classes reside directly in the /org/ directory and control or represent the robot as a whole.


<a name="robot"></a>[####Robot](#robot "Robot")

### AutonomousController



### AutonomousExecutables



### Profiles
